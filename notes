SRID # 97456
used UTM-8
I still need to creat two views to narrow down the counties to just GA
    georgia_counties_2000
    georgia_counties_2010
    
Used ArcMAP to narrow down the US County shapefiles to GA county shapefiles for 2000 and 2010
Today I added all of the districts and circuits to my map and then accidentally deleted them all!!
Circuits and districts are back and the shapefile is loaded to the database.
Used ArcMAP to dissolve the circuits and districts and then imported these 2 shapefiles
